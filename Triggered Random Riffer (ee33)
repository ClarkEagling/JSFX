//pseudocode:
//drop-down selected array of possible midi note values to use for root note
//arrays of steps in scale 
//array of possible note on / note off delays

//loop: 
//rootnote = slider picks from root note array,
//populate 8 variables with rootnote + randomly chosen step value (including
//populate 8 note on to note off timing variables
//populate 8 rest variables

//on midi trigger: re-roll variables
